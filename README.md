# express_reactv2

So, this new and improved Repo (I hope), it actually just has React and Express integrated together.
I am not a genius, I just spent some time watching Youtube videos and reading articles.

As of 25/03/2020, I still have not integrated Firebase as our database, but am working on
that now! Hopefully, it'll be integrated by next workshop. I've been working on setting
the basis of our server environment early, as we're all fairly not confident with our
coding, thus, probably needing a bit more time playing around with the code. Also, we need to start
preparing the prototype for Week 4, so I wanted to start working on that ASAP.

In order to properly access the servers, you'll have to install React and Express onto
you systems. I'll try to go step by step as best as I can, but if you need further
clarification on anything, please message me.

1. Add the repo to your own GitHub Desktop.
2. Download npm, if you don't have it installed onto your computer already. 
   - npm is a package manager for the node.js platform (Express framework) and it basically manages
     the dependencies of the server
3. Open your Terminal/Command Prompt and type the command 'cd eRestaurantv2'.
   - This should be the same for both Mac and Windows devices
4. Type 'npm install'
   - This is installing all the dependencies and files for the react framework
5. Type 'npm run client-install'
   - This is a custom script that is design the "cd" (go into) the client folder, and then install
   the express framework dependencies
   - NOTE: If this doesn't work, the script doesn't work (HAHAHAHAHA) Instead, run the commands
   separately, i.e. 'cd client' and then, 'npm install'.
6. Type 'npm run dev' to run both the react and express servers, simultaneously.
   - If you go to your web browser and type 'localhost:3000', you should see the sample customer
   names I put just to test it out :)
   	- SIDE NOTE: Since we're in quaratine, I recommend watching Marvel's Runaways, whose characters'
	names I put as samples. Unfortunately, only Season 1 is available on Disney+. Sadly, it only has
	a total of 3 seasons. 

OK! I'm done. ILY <3 We can do this!!
